# Personal LLM Project README

ðŸš€ Welcome to the **Personal LLM** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating various techniques and methodologies for working with Language Models (LM) using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers. Below is a detailed breakdown of the contents and functionalities provided in the notebook.

## Project Setup

### Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy
```

## Notebook Overview

### Data Preparation
- **Loading Data**: The notebook includes code snippets for loading and preprocessing text data.
- **Tokenization**: Utilizes Hugging Face tokenizers to prepare data for model training.

### Model Training
- **Model Initialization**: Demonstrates initializing a pre-trained model (`T5Model` in this case).
- **Training Loop**: Contains a detailed training loop for fine-tuning the model on custom data.
- **CUDA Handling**: Explicitly sets `use_cuda=False` to handle CUDA availability issues.

### Attention Mechanisms
- **Self-Attention**: Explains the self-attention mechanism in detail, including masking techniques for autoregressive models.
- **Attention Visualization**: Visualizes attention weights to understand how the model focuses on different parts of the input.

### Inference
- **Text Generation**: Provides examples of generating text using the fine-tuned model.
- **Placeholder Prompts**: Shows how to generate prompts for placeholders using the trained model.

### Advanced Techniques
- **Custom Layers**: Includes examples of adding custom layers to the model.
- **Loss Functions**: Discusses different loss functions and their implementations.

### Utilities
- **Data Export**: Code snippets for exporting results to CSV and JSON formats.
- **Visualization**: Various visualization techniques to understand model performance.

## Running the Notebook
